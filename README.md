# SC2107 Project

This repo contains the code used for the labs and final project for SC2107.
Specifically, the "Lab5_UARTComms" folder contains the final project codes, which is basically just the 
basic requirements, and a line follower FSM with auto stop/speed adjust and turning at the end of line.

Use at your own discretion. The evaluation will heavily emphasize understanding over just the working code.
